#### Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset about company layoffs from 2020 to 2023.

Situation: 

The project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset about company layoffs from 2020 to 2023.

Task: 

The primary task was to clean the data by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, handling null values, and preparing it for analysis to identify trends and patterns in layoffs.

Action: The following actions were taken:

Created staging tables for data manipulation and inserted data from the original table.
Removed duplicate records using SQL queries with window functions.
Standardized data by trimming whitespace and normalizing industry names.
Handled null values by updating missing industries based on related records and removing records with both total laid-off and percentage laid-off as null.
Performed exploratory data analysis by running various SQL queries to analyze key metrics such as total laid-off, percentage laid-off, and trends over time.

Result:

The data cleaning process resulted in a cleaned and standardized dataset ready for analysis. The exploratory data analysis provided insights into the scale and impact of layoffs across different companies, industries, and countries.

Reflection: This project demonstrated effective data cleaning techniques and exploratory analysis using SQL, providing valuable insights into company layoffs. Future improvements could include more detailed trend analysis and visualization using tools like Power BI.
